// class Fruit represents a piece of fruit that floats around the maze
// The fruit should move like other actors do with a speed of FRUIT_SPEED
// When it reaches the center of a square, the fruit should randomly choose a
// new direction based on the following rules:
//      1.  The direction should be chosen from those that lead to non-wall squares
//      2.  It should not reverse direction unless it is in a dead end
// Bonus: as the fruit moves around the maze, it should bob up and down a little bit.
