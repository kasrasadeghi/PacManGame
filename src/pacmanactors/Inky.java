// class Inky represents the light blue ghost (use color "Blue")
// Inky's scatter target is the bottom right corner of the maze
// Inky's chase target square is found as follows:  Let Blinky's location be B
//      Let M be the Location 2 squares in front of PacMan's current location
//      Let A be the point such that M is the midpoint of AB.  A is Inky's chase
//      target.  For example, if Blinky is at B(5, 3) and PacMan is at (7, 5) and
//      is facing right, then M is (7, 7), so A should be (9, 11)
