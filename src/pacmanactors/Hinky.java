// Hinky is a purple ghost (RGB = 128, 0, 128) which targets a random location
// (which must NOT be a wall square).
// he ONLY changes his target location when he reaches the center of the
// current target location.  His chase and scatter targets are the same (ie the 
// randomly chosen target location).
